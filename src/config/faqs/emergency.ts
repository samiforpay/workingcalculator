  },
  {
    question: "What counts as a true emergency?",
    answer: "True emergencies include job loss, medical emergencies, critical home repairs, essential car repairs, and other unexpected necessary expenses. Regular expenses are not emergencies."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I pay off debt or build emergency savings first?",
    answer: "Build a small emergency fund ($1,000-2,000) first, then focus on high-interest debt, while continuing to build your emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate my monthly expenses?",

  },
  {
    question: "Should I invest my emergency fund?",
    answer: "No, emergency funds should be kept in liquid accounts like savings accounts. While returns are lower, the priority is accessibility and stability, not growth."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take to build an emergency fund?",
    answer: "The time depends on your savings rate and target amount. Saving 10% of income monthly, it typically takes 2.5-5 years to build a full 3-6 month emergency fund."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to use my emergency fund?",
    answer: "Use it for true emergencies, then make rebuilding it a top priority. Adjust your budget to increase savings until the fund is replenished."
  },
  {
    question: "Should self-employed people have a larger emergency fund?",
    answer: "Yes, self-employed individuals and those with variable income should aim for 6-12 months of expenses due to less predictable income."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I review my emergency fund?",
    answer: "Review your emergency fund every 6-12 months or when major life changes occur (marriage, children, job change). Adjust the target amount based on current expenses."
