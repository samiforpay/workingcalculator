  {
    question: "What is a good ROI percentage?",
    answer: "A 'good' ROI varies by industry and investment type. Generally, 10-12% is considered good for stocks, 8-10% for real estate, and 20-30% for some business investments."
  },
  {
    question: "What factors affect ROI?",
    answer: "Key factors include initial investment cost, maintenance/operating costs, time period, market conditions, risk level, and potential returns."

  {
    question: "How does time affect ROI calculations?",
